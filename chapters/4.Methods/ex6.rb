What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

ANSWER:

It tells me that we create a method called calculate_product wich takes two
arguments but we just put one.
  
end
